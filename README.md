# NodeJS - Midterm Project

**Goal:** Create a site with BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) functionality using Node.js and Express as backend and a frontend of your choice. A user must be able to register, login, display, add, edit, and delete items.

## Instructions 📖

- You are free to create any type of site as long as it has CRUD/BREAD functionality and using MVC pattern.
- Keep the database in-memory or inside a model (No external database).
- The site must have login and signup.
- Use TypeScript.
- Use `bcrypt` package to hash and verify the password [https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt].
- Use `uuid` package to generate unique ids.
- Use cookie session to keep user information in the browser after they login. Clear the cookies when they log out.
- Create middleware so that BREAD routes are only accessible if the user is authenticated or logged in.
- You can choose to build your frontend/view using Astro, EJS (not preferable), or another library such as React if you prefer.
- Design your web application in Figma.

### Example Routes and Requests

- **Browse:** `GET /posts`
- **Read:** `GET /posts/1`
- **Search:** `GET /posts/search?q=keyword`
- **Edit:** `PUT /posts/1`
- **Add:** `POST /posts`
- **Delete:** `DELETE /posts/1`
---
- **Register** `POST /users/register`
- **Login** `POST /users/login`
